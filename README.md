# Fake-News-Detection-using-LSTM
# ðŸ“° Fake News Detection using NLP and Deep Learning

This project implements a binary text classification model to distinguish between real and fake news articles using LSTM-based deep learning. The model is trained on a dataset containing labeled news content and achieves high accuracy through comprehensive preprocessing and sequential modeling.

## Project Highlights

- Developed a deep learning model using **TensorFlow** and **Keras** with **LSTM** layers for text classification
- Achieved **99% accuracy** on the test set with strong precision, recall, and F1-score
- Utilized **Word Embeddings**, **Sequence Padding**, and **Tokenization** for efficient text vectorization
- Visualized key terms and patterns using **WordClouds** for both fake and real news categories
- Evaluated using **classification metrics** (precision, recall, F1-score) from `sklearn`
